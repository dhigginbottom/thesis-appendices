This repository contains appendices to Daniel Higginbottom's PhD thesis 'Atom-light couplers with one, two and ten billion atoms' submitted on the 29th of March 2018.

Appendix A - Dipole field images:

This Mathematica notebook contains the vector derivation of the dipole field imaged by a spherical lens or parabolic mirror. 
The apparent emmitter displacement, and the ellipticity of the maximally displaced dipole are calculated. 
The coupling efficiency of free-space collimators is determined by integrating the overlap of the field images with LG fibre modes.

Appendix B - Wavefronts of an elliptical dipole:

This Mathematica notebook derives analytical expressions for the wavefronts of a dipole field and plots the wavefronts as a function of dipole ellipticity. Supermomentum is exhibited by the wavefronts of the elliptical dipoles.
